# Concept of Sorting
- Goal: Arrange data in a specific order (ascending or descending).
- Benefits: Improves search efficiency, enables binary search, and helps in data organization.

## Sorting Algorithms

| Algorithm         | Time Complexity                   |   Stable? | In-place? |   Best Use Case               |
| ------------------| ----------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-------------------            |
| Bubble Sort       |   O(n^2)                          |   Yes     | Yes       |   Small datasets, teaching    |
| Selection Sort    |   O(n^2)                          |   No      | Yes       |   Simple implementation       |
| Quick Sort        |   O(n \log n) avg, O(n^2) worst   |   No      | Yes       |   Fast, general-purpose       |
| Merge Sort        |   O(n \log n)                     |   Yes     | No        |   Large datasets, stable sorting  |
